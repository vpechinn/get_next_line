The get_next_line function reads the next line from a file or standard input. It allocates memory to store this line, which needs to be freed by the user after use. The function stores the read line in the variable pointed to by line, and upon subsequent calls, it continues reading from where it left off.

This function is commonly used in scenarios where you need to read input from a file or the user line by line, such as parsing configuration files or processing textual data.
